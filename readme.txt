Make the dashboard Solarized, ease your eyes

== Description ==
Adds an admin color scheme which not only colorizes the admin menu and
the admin bar but the whole dashboard.

Use it if you know the dashboard, if you know the location of every part
of dashboard because Solarized's contrast is lower than other color schemes
to ease your eyes.

This plugin is based on [Ethan Schoonover's](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) project of the same name.

= How do I switch color scheme? =

On the Dashboard go to Users / Your Profile and click on "Solarized".
